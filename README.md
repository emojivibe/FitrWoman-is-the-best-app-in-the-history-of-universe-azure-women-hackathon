# FitrWomen
A complete website for women to ensure their good health. 

We researched and found that there are many apps for women,but they are limited to a specific section. This web application is one stop solution to discuss about different medical milestones, AI Disease prediction system and finally a translator to get the whole web app in the language one is comfortable with and hence dissolve any communication barrier.The web application offers different types of disease detection such as Heart Disease, Kidney disease etc. for early detection of the disease.
